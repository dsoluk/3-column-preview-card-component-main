## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Buttons
- Hover pseudo
- combinators

### What I learned

Finally got a reasonable understanding of centering elements (e.g. flexbox).

Now more comfortable with combinators.

### Continued development

I'm thinking I need a a tag around my buttons if they are to do anything like link as I think there are limitations unless in a form. Hopefully comes up in a future challenge.

Need to add code around transitions as my screens are ugly when resizing viewport.

### Useful resources

MDN website for flexbox, combinators and buttons. The W3 schools site has useful examples too. And codepen is awesome too.

## Acknowledgments

@TechNech from an earlier challenge feedback which motivated me to look at flexbox more carefully and figure out how to center the card(s).
